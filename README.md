# Predictive Employee Attrition Modeling through HR Data Remediation

## Overview

This project focuses on improving the accuracy of employee attrition prediction models by meticulously cleaning and preparing messy HR datasets.  The analysis involves handling missing values, resolving inconsistencies across disparate data sources, and standardizing data formats to create a high-quality dataset suitable for robust predictive modeling. The ultimate goal is to achieve a 15% improvement in the accuracy of employee retention predictions. This repository contains the data cleaning and preparation scripts.  Further predictive modeling would be a subsequent step.


## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print summary statistics and data quality assessments to the console, detailing the cleaning and standardization processes performed.  The script may generate visualizations (depending on the specific implementation), which will be saved as image files (e.g., `data_quality_report.png`, `missing_values_summary.png`) in the project directory.  These visualizations will provide a visual representation of data quality before and after the cleaning process.  The cleaned and prepared dataset will be saved as a CSV file (e.g., `cleaned_hr_data.csv`).
